In order to contribute proguard exclusion to a dependent project, this project must be published as an .aar file.

Apparently all the support for creating and publishing aar file exists for AndroidStudio/Gradle not Eclipse with Maven.

So the publishing now requires these extra steps:

1 The pom.xml file must have  <packaging>aar</packaging> under the first details like so:
  <groupId>org.jogamp.java3d</groupId>
  <artifactId>java3d-core-and</artifactId>
  <version>1.7.1</version>
  <packaging>aar</packaging> 
  
2  The jar file java3d-core-and-1.7.1.jar must be renamed 
  And then 
2a	classes.jar
2b  AndroidManifest.xml
2c  proguard.txt
  must be in the root of a zip file named
3  java3d-core-and-1.7.1.aar
4  Which together with the slightly modified pom file above are what needs to be uploaded to the maven server
